# Knwl.js
Knwl.js is a Javascript library that parses through text for dates, times, phone numbers, emails, places, and more.

Parser plugins are what make Knwl.js tick and give it new parsing abilities. There are many already available under ```./default_plugins``` for a number of tasks.
If you're interested in developing plugins for Knwl.js, ```./plugin_development.md``` is a great place to start.

## Installation

Installation instructions are specific to whether you want to run Knwl.js in the browser, or on the server with Node.js.

### For Node.js

#### Install using ```npm```:

```console
	npm install knwl.js
```

1. Load the ```knwl``` module using ```require()``` and create a new Instance.

	```javascript
		var Knwl = require("./knwl.js");
		
		var knwlInstance = new Knwl('english');
	```
	
	You can optionally specify a language in the first parameter. This helps plugins identify and better suit particular languages.

2. Load a parser plugin.

	```javascript
		knwlInstance.register('dates', require('./default_plugins/dates'));
	```
	
	The first parameter is the desired label for the plugin. The second parameter is a ```require()``` call to load the plugin.
	
	*Note: The plugins in the ```./default_plugins``` directory will be loaded automatically.*

### For the Browser

**Note: A packaged version of Knwl.js for the browser with default plugins is available in the ```./dist``` directory.**

These steps require the ```npm``` package.

1. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.

2. ```browserify``` may be used to build a Knwl.js project from Node.js for the browser.

	Use the following syntax in the terminal:
	
	```console
		./node_modules/.bin/browserify script.js knwl.js > output.js
	```
	
	The ```script.js``` file is the Node.js file you wish to package for the browser.

## Usage Guide

These steps are the same regardless of whether Knwl.js is running on the server or client.

3. Initiate Knwl.js on a String.

	``` javascript
	knwlInstance.init("This is a string. This was written on the 2nd of June, of 2015.");
	```
	
	This line runs the initial parser functions that
	prepare the String for plugins to use. **Plugins
	will not function without this method first being called
	on the String.**
	
4. Initiate a plugin to parse the String.
	
	``` javascript
	var dates = knwlInstance.get('dates');
	```
	
	The first parameter of ```knwl.get()``` is the
	name of the parser plugin you're trying to access (make sure you've added the plugin's .js file to the header of the page).
	The names of all default parser plugins are provided
	 towards the end of this document. If you're using
	plugins other than the defaults, see their respective
	documentation.
	
	Anyways, if the parser plugin is found, ```knwl.get()``` will return
	an array of this format:
	
	```javascript
	var results = [
		{ //result
			//plugin-specific properties
			"preview": "This was written on the 2nd of June of 2015.", //the sentence of rough location of the data from the String
			"found": integer //the position (in words) of the result in the String
		}
	]
	```
	
	For example, here's what is returned from ```knwl.get('dates')``` when called on the previously mentioned String:
	
	```json
	[
		{
			"year": 2015,
			"month": 6,
			"day": 2,
			"preview": "This was written on the 2nd of June of 2015.",
			"found": 5
		}
	]
	```

## Default Plugins

These are automatically loaded by default.

### dates.js
```javascript
knwl.get('dates');
	
	//Returns any dates found in the String.
```

### times.js
```javascript
knwl.get('times');
	
	//Returns any times found in the String.
	
```

### phones.js
```javascript		
knwl.get('phones')

	//Returns any phone numbers found in the String.

```

### links.js
```javascript
knwl.get('links')

	//Returns any links found in the String.

```

### emails.js
```javascript
knwl.get('emails')
	
	//Returns any email addresses found in the String.
```

### places.js
```javascript
knwl.get('places')

	//Returns any places found in the String.
```

## Experimental Plugins

### Notice: These plugins have not been upgraded to the new syntax.

These parser plugins are not as accurate as the default plugins. However,
they should be stable (they shouldn't crash the page) to use if you are willing to use them. They are considerably more static and rigid than default plugins.

In the future, some of these plugins may reach a level of accuracy that promotes them
from experimental status to the default plugins. However, some will merely stay
as experiments.

### english.js
```javascript
knwl.get('english')

	//Returns the simple parts (verb, subject, etc.) of basic sentences found in the String.
	//WARNING: this is a rigid and simplistic plugin, thus it is merely an experiment.
```
### units.js
```javascript
knwl.get('units')
	
	//Returns any units (grams, pounds, etc.) found in the String.
```
## Developing Parser Plugins

What's awesome about the new version of Knwl.js is that it makes it much easier
for anyone with a little knowledge of JS to build plugins. These plugins offer new
parsing abilities for Knwl.js that otherwise wouldn't exist.

If you want to try your hand at building plugins for Knwl.js, there's documentation available in ```plugin_development.md```.
